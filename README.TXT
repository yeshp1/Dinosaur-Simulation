To start, run the main() method of the Simulator class.

This program simulates the populations of dinosaurs according to a variety of different factors including
the environment, the specific traits of each of the actors and the interactions of actors amongst each other.
The current configuration simulates the populations of 5 dinosaurs mostly from the mesozoic era.

By default dinosaurs age, reproduce, search for a food source, and get diseased. However, these behaviors may be altered
and affected by the current state of the environment such as time of day and the weather. In addition, dinosaurs may be
created with randomised age and food level.
Even though, a Plant class does exist and is functional within the simulation, in the current configuration it is not
spawned in the field in order to better balance the existing population.
